	fEMR is a free and light weight electronic medical record system that we are currently developing to help the School of Medicine's World Health Student Organization deal with administrative issues when they work in Haiti.

This is an open source project being developed in the Play Framework. We are utilizing Google Guice for dependency injection and Avaje Ebean for object-relational mapping. Version control is managed using Git.

	<h1>About fEMR - Free Electronic Medical Records</h1>
	In January 2010, the Republic of Haiti experienced a violent magnitude-7.0 earthquake that displaced
millions of people throughout the country and damaged an already struggling and insufficient infrastructure. 
Among the problems faced by Haiti, especially in the wake of the earthquake, is adequate access to medical 
care for its citizens. According to the World Health Organization before the 2010 earthquake, 46% of Haitians 
did not have access to health care because they either lacked the funds or access to facilities, and 43% lack recommended immunization.</br></br> 

Because of this lack of access to affordable health care, many organizations travel to Haiti each year to set up 
free clinics. Unfortunately, many of these clinics document their patient's visits with only paper forms that are 
not archived or maintained. This provides many problems for the clinicians: uncertainty about previous treatment, 
trends in patient health may go unnoticed, among others. Due to a general lack of infrastructure in many regions 
of the country, however, traditional Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems do not provide the needed functionality. 
In many regions, especially rural, people see physicians only once or twice per year travelling with teams that set up 
transient clinics. Such clinics are set up for high volumes in order to reach a large number of people in a very short 
amount of time. The environment of these clinics is chaotic and intense. For this reason, the clinicians must form a 
dynamic organization to respond to moment-by-moment situational change, often-times unexpected, in order to 
maintain the fast-pace and reach the team's goal for the mission.</br></br>

The School of Medicine’s World Health Student Organization is one of the teams working in Haiti. This organization 
requires a light EMR system that is tailored to such a temporary clinic. This system will help them deal with the 
unique issues related to the administration of a clinic. Despite the environmental conditions where the clinic runs, 
it is currently possible to set up a lightweight infrastructure for the operation of the EMR system. The potential 
benefits are many-fold: tracking patient encounters from year to year, improving planning for future medical missions,
and improving understanding of the patient population through long-term data collection.
