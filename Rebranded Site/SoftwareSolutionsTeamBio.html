															<h3>Amber Dawkins</h3> </header>
															<p>
																My name is Amber and I love to learn about new technologies. I will be recieving a B.S. in computer science. When I first entered college, I knew that I wanted to do something hands on as oppose to just starring at a computer all day. But after taking a few electives I found that my interest lies in web and software development. There is much more for me to learn, so I intend to continue my education by going for my Masters degree.

															I am currently pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at Wayne State University. Following my graduation, I intend to pursue a Master's of Science in Computer Science with a focus on Software Engineering and Parallel Computing.  My passion for technology and learning has led me to pursue a career within the field of information technology.  Throughout my career I would like to enable people from various backgrounds to access quality educational resources and connect with one another despite differences in geographic location, culture, and socioeconomic status.

																<h3>Matthew King</h3>

															<p>
															I've always been interested in computers since I was a youngster, whether playing video games or building computers. Going into computer science just seemed to be a no brainer. I have made a website before this class, and I am currently maintaining and updating my church's website. I also run the media team at my church.
