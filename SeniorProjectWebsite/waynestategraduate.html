															<h3>Project Description</h3> 
														</header>
														<p>
															The Wayne State University Graduate School is among the 20 largest in the nation. Graduate students often participate in cutting edge research and large scale creative projects in their fields as they work towards earning a master’s degree or a doctorate. Every year in early March, the Wayne State University Graduate School holds an exhibition that features the work of graduate students from the various disciplines in the university. The purpose of the exhibition is "celebrating Wayne State's graduate community and the exciting research, scholarship and creative work of [Wayne State] graduate students."  </br>
															During the Exhibition, the students participate by presenting a poster, art project or oral presentation that focuses on their research or work. The students' presentations are evaluated by professors who have volunteered to act as judges. The results of the evaluations are used to determine which of the projects will receive awards in several categories at a ceremony at the culmination of the exhibition. </br>
