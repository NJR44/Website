															<h2>Project: </br></br>Rehabilitation Fish Arcade Game</h2>
															<span class="byline"></span>
														</header>
														<header>
															<h3>Project Description</h3> 
														</header>
														<p>
															The Fish Arcade game is a fairly simple design that works closely with the patient and the therapist. This game will allow a therapist to pre-set settings for their patient's game sessions. The game will then walk the patients through a brief understanding of the game and calibration of the game controls to gauge the patients progress in their healing without hindering them while they play the game. All of the data will then be recorded and dated as to help the therapist further understand the progress of the patient in this matter.
